# Supplementary Material of Flexible Testing in a Pandemic 
We use the testing data provided by the COVID-19 Tracking Project who collects, cross-checks and publishes COVID-19 testing and outcome data from 56 US states and territories. All data comes from state and territory public health authorities or official statements from state officials. Not all states report all data. Testing data includes both polymerase chain reaction tests which test current infection, and antibody tests which test past infection. In this research, we focus on the diagnostic tests which is polymerase chain reaction tests. To view more descriptions about data, please visit https://covidtracking.com/about-data.
